The recent escalation in tensions between India and Pakistan has begun to show significant economic consequences, particularly in the border regions and cross-border trade activities.

## Business Community Response

Local business communities on both sides have called for immediate de-escalation and resumption of trade activities. Industry leaders emphasize the importance of maintaining economic ties despite political differences.

## Long-term Economic Outlook

Economic experts warn that prolonged tensions could lead to:

- Reduced foreign direct investment
- Higher defense spending
